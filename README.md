# Morning Pages
### #mongodb #hacktoberfest #hacktoberfest2018 #stitch

My [MongoDB Stitch Hacktoberfest](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/welcome-to-hacktoberfest-2018) submission is based on "Morning Pages", a daily writing exercise Julia Cameron recommends to creatives in her book 'The Artist's Way'.  

'Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning. *There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages*– they are not high art. They are not even “writing.” They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind– and they are for your eyes only. Morning Pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand. Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put three pages of anything on the page...and then do three more pages tomorrow.' -Julia Cameron, https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/

## Tech Stack
